### Aim

The aim of the workshop is to give an introduction to time-varying parameter models and Bayesian inference for such models, with an outlook to some new developments. The workshop consists of lectures on the models, theory and computations, with some light demos in R. The participants are expected to leave the workshop with enough knowledge to solve the computer lab exercises by themselves after the workshop.

[Mattias Villani](https://mattiasvillani.com)<br> Professor of
Statistics<br> Stockholm University

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Bayesian statistics is assumed. 
- Familiarity with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is needed for some parts of the workshop. 
- Basic knowledge of R is needed to follow along in the demos (although this is a small part of the workshop).

### Before the workshop

It is not necessary to bring your own laptop, but if you want to follow along in the demos, participants are encouraged to:

-   Install R and RStudio
-   Install the `dlm` package in R
