    "text": "Star\n\nHalf-day workshop at University of Technology Sydney (UTS)\n\n\nAim\nThe aim of the workshop is to give a introduction to time-varying parameter models and Bayesian inference for such models, with an outlook to some new developments. The workshop consists of lectures on the models, theory and computations, with some light demos in R. The participants are expected to leave the workshop with enough knowledge to solve the computer lab exercises by themselves after the workshop.\n\n\nInstructor\n\nMattias Villani Professor of Statistics Stockholm University\n\n\nBefore the workshop\nIt is not necessary to bring your own laptop, but if you want to follow along in the demos, participants are encouraged to:\n\nInstall R and RStudio\nInstall the dlm package in R\n\n\n\nPlan and material\n\nLecture 1 - Time-varying parameter models and state-space models Reading: Bayesian Learning - Chapter 17 | Slides - TBA Interactivity: local level | local trend | time-varying regression\nLecture 2 - Inference in linear Gaussian models Reading: Bayesian Learning - Chapter 17 | Slides - TBA Interactivity: filtering local level | nile river data\nLecture 3 - Inference in non-linear and non-Gaussian models Reading: Slides - TBA Interactivity: poisson time series | stochastic volatility\nLecture 4 - Global-local shrinkage processes for more realistic parameter evolutions Reading: Slides - TBA Interactivity: local level model with dsp prior | poisson with dsp prior\nComputer lab computer lab - TBA"
